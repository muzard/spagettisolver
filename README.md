As the name implies, a spaghetti solver

Solver for poker hands, atm functionality is limited to a deck that works(dealing, making tables etc) and solving the best hand out of five cards.
Project is in finnish atm.

Future plans include translation, splitting the file into pieces and creating an efficient solver for 7 cards. 

At the time of writing this will be achieved by brute force, unless I get a better idea or someone is kind enough to share one with me.
